This is Msc AI Final Project Repo from Bing Yuan in MTU with Student  ID: R00181773

Project Introduction:

In the last decade, there was an explosion in Natural Language Process applications led by the progress of Deep Learning architectures. Recently, Google researchers published BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a deep bidirectional language model based on the Transformer architecture [3], and advanced the state-of-the-art in many popular NLP tasks, including Machine Translation, Information Retrieval, and Sentiment Analysis. Emotion Detection is a sub-branch of Sentiment Analysis that focuses on detecting specific emotions. This project investigated the combination of emotion detection using Deep learning methods with rule-based Chatbot such as ELIZA. To improve the performance of conversation of agent focus on helping People with Obesity

There are three Repository within this folder

- Eliza : is the original code based on the original paper. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA
- Smart_Eliza_ML_NB : is the Basedline version of Smart-ELIZA using Machine Learning Navie Bayes 
- Smart_Eliza_DL_BERT : is the BERT based version of Smarlt-ELIZA using Deep Learning.
